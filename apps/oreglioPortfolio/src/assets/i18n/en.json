    "about-1": "I am an Italo-Chinese guy working as a Frontend Developer. My journey into the coding world began during high school years when I discovered my passion for programming through an afternoon course that compared English syntax with that of JavaScript. Throughout my professional path, I have developed solid technical skills and fundamental soft skills. I am a quick learner when it comes to new technologies.",
    "about-2": "When I'm not in front of the monitor, I love feeling the wind on my motorcycle. Spending time on the road allows me to clear my mind, finding inspiration even for my most complex projects. Additionally, I regularly go to the gym to maintain a healthy balance between mind and body, thus fueling my health and productivity."
